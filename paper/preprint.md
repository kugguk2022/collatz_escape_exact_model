## Abstract
We present an open-source atlas for a Collatz-forced tetration family: a symbolically forced transcendental dynamical system whose stability depends on traversal direction. We show a sharp transition in which one direction remains confined to an attracting basin while the opposite direction develops a dominant escape channel. We quantify this non-reciprocal stability using escape rates and finite-time Lyapunov statistics and relate the observed filamentary structures to dynamic rays and symbolic addresses familiar from exponential-family dynamics.
