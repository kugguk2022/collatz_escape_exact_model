# Glossary: your terms → literature terms

- **Collatz scape / bay** → attracting basin / Fatou component
- **Bay boundary** → Julia set (boundary of stability)
- **Parity path** → itinerary (symbolic dynamics)
- **Quasiparticle filament** → dynamic ray / external ray (with external address)
- **Direction lock / one-way protection** → direction-dependent Lyapunov / non-reciprocal stability (descriptive)
- **Hyper growth / ejection** → escape to infinity / escaping set

Notes:
- “Non-reciprocal” is standard in nonequilibrium physics; here it’s a useful *descriptor* for direction-asymmetric stability,
  not a claim that the mathematical community has a single canonical label for this exact mechanism.
